# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Divide and conquer is a paradigm for solving problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems, solving each recursively, and combining their results.

## Algorithms
1. Merge Sort->
    Time Complexity: 
        Best Case- O(nlogn)
        Average Case- O(nlogn)
        Worst Case- O(nlogn)
   
    Space Complexity: 
        O(n)
   
2. Quick Sort->
    Time Complexity: 
        Best Case- O(nlogn)
        Average Case- O(nlogn)
        Worst Case- O(n^2)
   
    Space Complexity: 
        O(1)

3. Strassen's Matrix Multiplication->
    Time Complexity: 
        Best Case- O(n^2.81)
        Average Case- O(n^2.81)
        Worst Case- O(n^2.81)
   
    Space Complexity: 
        O(n^2)
