# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

Divide and conquer is a paradigm for solving problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems, solving each recursively, and combining their results.

    Time Complexity: 
        Best Case- O(nlogn)
        Average Case- O(nlogn)
        Worst Case- O(nlogn)
   
    Space Complexity: 
        O(n)
