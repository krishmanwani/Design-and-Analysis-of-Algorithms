# Greedy Approach

A Greedy Algorithm is a simple way to solve problems by taking the best choice at each step without worrying about the future. 
The idea is to make decisions that seem the most beneficial at the moment, hoping they lead to the best overall solution.

## Algorithms
1. Fractional Knapsack Problem->
    - Time Complexity:
        - Best Case- O(nlogn)
	- Average Case- O(nlogn)
	- Worst Case- O(nlogn)
    - Space Complexity:
	- O(n^2)
